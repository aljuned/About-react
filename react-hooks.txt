Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.


Before we continue, note that Hooks are:

Completely opt-in. You can try Hooks in a few components without rewriting any existing code. But you don’t have to learn or use Hooks right now if you don’t want to.
100% backwards-compatible. Hooks don’t contain any breaking changes.
Available now. Hooks are now available with the release of v16.8.0.
